# Chatbox App

## Developed a chat box application for your system which covers following scenarios :-
* A button to add multiple chat boxes. When you click on this button a chat box should be added on the screen. Ex. if you click 5 times on the add button the five chat boxes appears on the screen.
* Chat box should consist of a text area, a send button, and a place to display messages. Just like a Facebook or any other chat box.
* When a user sends the message from any box,  it should be displayed in all the chat boxes visible on the screen including himself.
* The messages displayed in the box should be aligned to left(self message) and right(other's message).
* Option to close the chat box.
